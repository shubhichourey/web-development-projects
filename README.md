Here, I made some projects related to web development using HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT.

1. AMAZON CLONE:
This is a clone which replicates Amazon's look and feel and creating it with HTML and CSS serves as a exercise in web development, demonstrating the fundamental principles of front-end design.

2. CARDS:
The "Interactive Hover Cards," is a mesmerizing showcase of HTML and CSS, demonstrating how these core technologies can be leveraged to create visually appealing and user-engaging content on the web.

3. PASSWORD GENERATOR:
This creates a simple password generator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows the user to specify password length and select character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols) to include in the password and a random password meeting the specified criteria is displayed in the input field.

4. SHOPPING LIST:
This simple shopping list web application allows users to add items to their list, view the list, and delete items when they are no longer needed. It features basic styling, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
