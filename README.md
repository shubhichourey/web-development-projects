Here, I made some projects related to web development using HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT.

1. AMAZON CLONE:
This is a clone which replicates Amazon's look and feel and creating it with HTML and CSS serves as a exercise in web development, demonstrating the fundamental principles of front-end design.

2. CARDS:
The "Interactive Hover Cards," is a mesmerizing showcase of HTML and CSS, demonstrating how these core technologies can be leveraged to create visually appealing and user-engaging content on the web.
